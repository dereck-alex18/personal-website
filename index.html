          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Dereck and I've been in tecknology since when I
            was a kid. Majored in Electronic Engineering in 2017 at University
            of Pernambuco (UPE) and currently studying System Development at
            CESAR School. At the moment, I'm working as Software Test Engineer
            at CI&T.

        <h2>More About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My journey started in 2016 when I got my first inter an intern of
          Embedded System Development at Recife City Hall. After that I joined a
          summer job at CESAR, a company from Recife witch is technology and
          innovation reference. Due to my performance there, I could land my
          first internship with Software Testing. Spent almost one year as a
          Software Tester intern at CESAR, I move to Autria due to Personal
          Reasons. In 2019 I returned to Brazil and landed a job as a QA at MV,
          a company from Recife that works with health technology. There I could
          have my frist automation touch involving testing a mobile application.
          Then, after about 10 months, joinedliferay where I could work with
          manual, automation and also trainning new team members. After that, I
          had an opportunity to work at CESAR again. In this second time at the
          compaby I could have a strong development in my career, participating
          in choosing the best framework to start an E2E automation, learned how
          to automate in another layers instead of only E2E, started to review
          PRs along with the Dev team and so on. Currently, I'm seeking to
          improve my hard and softskills and maybe in the future, explore
          different areas in the IT world.

          Apart from my professional life, I'm a Perfume enthusiast onwing
          different fragrance in my collection even those that are no longer
          manufactured. Love playing video-games in my free time, spending time
          watching movies and videos on Youtube with my girlfriend and,
          sometimes, hanging out with my friends at a bar or something similar.
          To sum up, I'm passionated about learning new things and always
          looking forward to starting new challenges.
